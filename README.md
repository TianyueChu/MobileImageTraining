# On-Device Training with ONNX Runtime on Android (Java)

This repository demonstrates how to perform **on-device training** on Android devices with Java.  devices, enabling efficient, decentralized learning.

## Features

- **On-Device Training**: Train models directly on Android devices without requiring server interaction.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Leverages the ONNX Runtime library for efficient model inference and training.
- **Android Integration**: Example project designed for Android Studio with Java.
- **Pre-trained Model Fine-Tuning**: Includes a sample script for using pre-trained MobileNet models in [FedFlower](https://github.com/TianyueChu/FedFlower) project.
